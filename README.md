# SPContribute
My aim in this repository is to collect all reusable artifacts I create for SharePoint and share them with other developers. I'm going to little by little add many stuff here that everyone can easily plug into their SharePoint project or even their IDE to accelerate the development and reduce bugs and avoid pitfalls ;)
